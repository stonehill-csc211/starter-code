# Starter Code for CSC211

We will use this repository as starter code for all of our in-class programming activities.

Over the course of the semester, I will write code in this project if I want you to have it. At the end of the semester, you should submit it as your data-structures-lib assignment. I will add to this readme with a list of the classes I am looking for when I grade that.

DataStructuresLib Classes (graded at the end of the semester):
* MyArrayList
* MyLinkedList
* ArrayStack
* LinkedQueue
* BinarySearchTree
* TreeMap

Ungraded in-class activities:
* MysteryFunction
* BalancedParens
* Search (mazes)
* Binary Search Tree intersection
*
